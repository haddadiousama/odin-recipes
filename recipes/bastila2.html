        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chicken bastilla is Morocco's famous chicken pie. A light, crispy warqa pastry shell conceals savory saffron chicken, spicy omelet stuffing, and a crunchy topping of fried almonds sweetened with orange flower water. A garnish of powdered sugar and cinnamon adds to the unique blend of flavors.

                This authentic recipe does take some time to prepare, but you'll find it well worth the effort. Take your time and follow the steps on how to assemble the bastilla and you should not find the recipe too challenging. In fact, you can make the bastilla a day or more in advance, and refrigerate or freeze until baking time. If you enjoy making this chicken version, you may want to give seafood bastilla a try.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>For the chicken:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (5-pound) chicken</li>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 large sweet onions, coarsely chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground white pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads</li>
                <li>2 to 3 sticks cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the chicken into pieces, discarding the skin. Add the butter and oil to a large Dutch oven or other heavy duty pot and heat on medium until the butter melts. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the spices and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the chicken pieces and stir to coat. Cover, and cook over medium to medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is very tender and falls off the bone. Do not add water, and be careful not to burn the chicken or the sauce as this will ruin the dish.</li>
                <br><li>Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate, and reduce the sauce in the pot until most of the liquids have evaporated and the onions form a mass in the oil. Stir occasionally, and adjust the heat as necessary to prevent burning. Remove and discard the cinnamon sticks.</li>
                <br><li>While the sauce is reducing and the chicken is still warm, pick the meat off the bones, breaking it into bite-size pieces. Place in a bowl and stir in several spoonfuls of the onion mixture; cover the meat and set aside.</li>
